# Netlify redirects

This project is a minimal web site hosted at
[netlify.com](http://netlify.com) that provides http redirection
for the following GNU MCU Eclipse v4.x update sites:

- https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates
- https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates-test
- https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates-experimental

## To Eclipse

In 2021-02-18, the final 4.7.2 release was uploaded to the Eclipse download
site, and all `v4-neon-updates` redirects were updated to point to
https://download.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/releases/4.7.2/p2/.

## To Bintray (deprecated)

Previously the http redirections pointed to bintray
(https://dl.bintray.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/v4-neon-updates) but
in 2021 the bintray.com site was deprecated.
